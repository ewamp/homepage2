## Demo

## Description

A simple website contains short overview of 5 must-see places in Norway.
The project has been written as a training task within Java Script course, in order to brush up all of the skills, knowledge and technologies which I've leared at the moment.
Apart from beautiful landscapes I've attached two pictures of trails. By a short code you can enlarge or reduce a size, depending on the needs.
